The OSPC-PL is a public license for Physiomodel with three modes/alternatives (GPL, OSPC-Internal, OSPC-External) for use and redistribution, in source and/or binary/object-code
form:
* GPL. Any party (member or non-member of OSPC) may use and redistribute Physiomodel under GPL version 3.
* Level 1 members of OSPC may also use and redistribute Physiomodel under OSPC-Internal conditions.
* Level 2 members of OSPC may also use and redistribute Physiomodel under OSPC-Internal or OSPC-External conditions.

Definitions of OSPC Public license modes:
* GPL = GPL version 3.
* OSPC-Internal = These OSPC Public license conditions together with the Additional Condition that use and redistribution by an OSPC member is only allowed within the OSPC member's own organization (i.e., its own legal entity), or for an OSPC member paying a membership fee corresponding to the size of the organization including all its affiliates, use and redistribution is allowed within/between its affiliates.
* OSPC-External = These OSPC Public license conditions together with the Additional Condition that use and redistribution by an OSPC member, or by a Licensed Third Party Distributor having a redistribution agreement with that member, to parties external to the OSPC member’s own organization (i.e., its own legal entity) is only allowed in binary/object-code form, except the case of redistribution to other OSPC members to which source is also allowed to be distributed.
[This has the consequence that an external party who wishes to use Physiomodel in source form together with its own proprietary software in all cases must be a member of OSPC].

In all cases of usage and redistribution by recipients, the following conditions also apply:
a) Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, all definitions, and
conditions. It is sufficient if the OSPC-PL Header is present in each source file, if the full
OSPC-PL is available in a prominent and easily located place in the redistribution.
b) Redistributions in binary/object-code form must reproduce the above copyright notice, all
definitions, and conditions. It is sufficient if the OSPC-PL Header and the location in the
redistribution of the full OSPC-PL are present in the documentation and/or other materials
provided with the redistribution, if the full OSPC-PL is available in a prominent and easily
located place in the redistribution.
c) A recipient must clearly indicate its chosen usage mode of OSPC-PL, in accompanying
documentation and in a text file OSPC-USAGE-MODE.txt, provided with the distribution.
d) Contributor(s) making a Contribution to Physiomodel thereby also makes a Transfer of
Contribution Copyright. In return, upon the effective date of the transfer, OSPC grants the
Contributor(s) a Contribution License of the Contribution. OSPC has the right to accept or
refuse Contributions.

Definitions:

For Contributors licensing Physiomodel under OSPC-Internal or OSPC-External conditions, the following conditions also hold:
Contributions do not include additions to the distributed Program which: (i) are separate
modules of software distributed in conjunction with Physiomodel under their own license
agreement, (ii) are separate modules which are not derivative works of Physiomodel, and

internal distribution according to OSPC-Internal and/or Additional Condition for
external distribution according to OSPC-External.
"Transfer of Contribution Copyright" means that the Contributors of a Contribution transfer the
ownership and the copyright of the Contribution to Open Source Physiomodel Consortium, the
Physiomodel Copyright owner, for inclusion in Physiomodel. The transfer takes place upon the
effective date when the Contribution is made available on the OSPC web site under OSPC-PL, by
such Contributors themselves or anyone acting on such Contributors' behalf. The transfer is free of charge. If the Contributors or OSPC so wish, an optional Copyright transfer agreement can be signed between OSPC and the Contributors, as specified in an Appendix of the OSPC Bylaws.
"Contribution License" means a license from OSPC to the Contributors of the Contribution, effective on the date of the Transfer of Contribution Copyright, where OSPC grants the Contributors a nonexclusive, world-wide, transferable, free of charge, perpetual license, including sublicensing rights, to use, have used, modify, have modified, reproduce and or have reproduced the contributed material, for business and other purposes, including but not limited to evaluation, development, testing, integration and merging with other software and distribution.

A Contributor licensing Physiomodel under OSPC-Internal or OSPC-External may
choose to distribute (parts of) Physiomodel in object code form under its own license agreement,
provided that: a) it complies with the terms and conditions of OSPC-PL; or for the case of redistribution of Physiomodel together with proprietary code it is a dual license where the Physiomodel parts are distributed under OSPC-PL compatible conditions and the proprietary code is distributed under proprietary license conditions; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and
implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct,
indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from OSPC-PL are offered by that Contributor
alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states from where the source code for Physiomodel is available, and informs licensees
how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
exchange.
When PHYSIOMODEL is made available in source code form:
a) it must be made available under OSPC-PL; and
b) a copy of OSPC-PL must be included with each copy of PHYSIOMODEL.
c) a copy of the subsidiary license associated with the selected mode of OSPC-PL must be included with each copy of PHYSIOMODEL.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within PHYSIOMODEL.
If there is a conflict between OSPC-PL and the subsidiary license conditions, OSPC-PL has priority.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of Czech Republic. The place of jurisdiction for all disagreements related to this Agreement, is Prague, Czech Republic.
